# ESP-32-Business-Card
Personal Business Card with fully functional ESP-32 and NFC

Latest version V0.2

Friends with version V0.1: PLEASE TAKE NOTE!
DO NOT USE CLIP POINT USB 5V! IT WILL SHORT TO GROUND!

For DIY users:
V0.1 is flawed with mixed up tx/rx traces! Enamel wires need to be flown to use ESP32!
SW1 does not work with resistor R9, it is recommended to short the pads across R9.
